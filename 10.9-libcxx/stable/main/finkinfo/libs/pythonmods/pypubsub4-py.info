Description: Publish - subscribe API
DescDetail: <<
PyPubSub provides a publish - subscribe API that facilitates the
development of event-based / message-based applications.  PyPubSub supports
sending and receiving messages between objects of an application.  It is
centered on the notion of a topic; senders publish messages of a given
topic, and listeners subscribe to messages of a given topic.  The package
also supports a variety of advanced features that facilitate debugging and
maintaining pypubsub topics and messages in larger applications.
