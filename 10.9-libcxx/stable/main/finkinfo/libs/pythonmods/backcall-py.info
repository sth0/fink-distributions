Description: Specifications for callback functions
DescDetail: <<
This module contains specifications for callback functions passed in to an API.
If your code lets other people supply callback functions, it's important to
specify the function signature you expect, and check that functions support
that. Adding extra parameters later would break other peoples code unless
you're careful. backcall provides a way of specifying the callback signature
using a prototype function callback_prototype.
If the callback takes fewer parameters than your prototype, backcall will wrap
it in a function that discards the extra arguments. If the callback expects
more arguments, a TypeError is thrown when it is registered.
