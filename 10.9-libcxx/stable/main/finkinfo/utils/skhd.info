Description: Simple hotkey daemon
DescDetail: <<
skhd is a simple hotkey daemon for macOS. It is a stripped version of
khd (no longer maintained) (although rewritten from scratch), that
sacrifices the more advanced features in favour of increased
responsiveness and performance. skhd is able to hotload its config
file, meaning that hotkeys can be edited and updated live while skhd
is running.
<<
DescUsage: <<
Copy the example skhdrc from %p/share/doc/%n/examples into ~/.skhdrc
to get started.

If you'd like to have skhd start automatically at login, you may
copy the example launchagent config from
%p/share/doc/%n/examples/com.koekeishiya.skhd.plist into
~/Library/LaunchAgents and start it for the first time with
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.koekeishiya.skhd.plist

skhd needs to be authorized to use accessibility features, and will
request access on the first run.
